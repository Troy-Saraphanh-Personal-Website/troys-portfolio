Hi, thank you for reading this! 

all images and files used for the portfolio are stored in the assets folder. 

All the general styling for the html files are written on "style.css" and the media queries for small screen sizes are written on "mediaqueries.css" The fonts used on the webpages have been imported from google fonts. 

The "javascript.js" file currently contains the code for the hamburger menu for the mobile navbar.
